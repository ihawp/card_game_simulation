# Rules

<sup>Last Updated: November 6, 2025.</sup>

A players turn consists of being dealt at least 1 card from the non-replacement deck.

## Card Values (in Grapples):
- Joker: 2
- Queen/King: 7
- Jack: 3
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (number cards) are worth their face value.
- Ace: 1

## If the card is a...
- 2 or a Joker: they are dealt a second card on that turn only.
- Jack: they can request to become the dealer by politely asking the current dealer to "tap out."

## Dealer:
There are 54 cards (standard deck with 2 jokers), any player can and likely will play as the dealer.

Any dealer can look at the top card before any of their turns while they are the dealer. The dealer can deal the card they see to themself or give it to the player on the left/right of them. If the dealer chose to give the card to another player, the cards will be dealt in that direction, ultimately the dealer must choose which direction the cards will be dealt each time it is their turn.

If any player draws the Ace of Spades they can redeem it to immediatley become the dealer, or discard it.

The first dealer is determined by pulling cards  (every player gets a card) from the pile until only one person has the highest value card.

## Dealer: Tap Out

A dealer can "tap out" and the player to their left will become the dealer.

Once a dealer "taps out" the player can only deal again if they draw a Jack and the dealer at that time agrees to give up their position as dealer. If the dealer accepts the players request, the player must give the Jack to the dealer.

A dealer must "tap out" after 4 turns. The dealer can look at the top card before their first turn.

Loan Shark:

Any player who draws a Queen can trade it for 3 cards from another players hand or keep it. 

The Queen of Spades can be traded for half of another players hand. If the amount of cards that the player you are taking from has is odd, the player must give you (n - 1)/ 2 cards in return for your queen or 3 cards, whichever is larger.

Assuming all players are keeping their cards generally hidden, the player must point at the cards they want to trade the Queen for. The other player must accept the trade.
